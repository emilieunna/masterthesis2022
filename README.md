Master thesis from Roskilde University spring 2022 - Energy consumption of WordPress plugins
Abstract for the thesis:
30-40\% of all web pages available worldwide are created using WordPress. This master thesis studies energy consumption when comparing plugins available to WordPress website creators. The plugins Elementor, Imagify and EWWW were tested additionally to running an experiment without any plugins.
The experiment uses two Raspberry Pi computers to act as server and client respectively. To imitate online end-user behaviour, testing has been automated using the tool; Selenium. The results show a significant difference in energy consumption when using the different plugins. The findings of the experiments suggest that it is feasible to create energy labels for WordPress plugins, enabling website creators to make more informed decisions regarding potential energy saving as well as creating an incentive for developers to develop more energy-efficient plugins for future use. In continuation of the thesis' experiments it would contribute with greater insight to look into temperatures affect on the processors performance and testing a plugin with a similar functionality to Elementor.

The github contains the scripts from the automation of the experiments conducted during the work with the thesis. The full scrip for conducting the data analysis on the collected data.
